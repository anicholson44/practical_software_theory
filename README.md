# Practical Software Theory

## What is this?

This project is a place to put knowledge that is useful for software engineering

## Why does this exist?

I have two primary motivations for creating this project (one selfish and one not):
1. I believe that knowledge of computer science (and other relevant scientific disciplines) is not widely or evenly distributed among software engineers, and spreading some basic familiarity with certain theories could benefit a lot of engineers individually and improve the quality of the software we build as a whole.
2. I can see that I have big gaps in my knowledge, and this project provides a focused and collaborative way to work on that.
